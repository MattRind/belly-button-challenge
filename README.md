# belly-button-challenge
This challenge is associated with Module 14, javascript. In this repo there are 2 files, `index.html` and `samples.json`, and one folder `static`, which contains `app.js`, all of which were provided from Assignment. All original code written me is in `app.js`. I did not modify `index.html`. This assignment was more challenging than others (for me) and as a result I learned some new things. structure of json file
- display of the metadata card: in order to display each key-value on its own line, I found that appending `('table')` even though this tag did not exist in `index.html`! Appending just to `("card-body")`, which was in the html file, or a table row `('tr')` did not prevent each key-value pair from appending to itself. I thought about adding a carriage return to the append, but could not find code for this.
- datatype issue with Plotly: The labels (yticks) of the bars in the bar plot are from the list of OTU-Ids, from which the values are of text type (but appear as integers) were being read as integers when plotted. Converting the values using `.toString()` and verifying with `typeof(value)` did not work. Adding a string to each Id in a `map()` function worked.
